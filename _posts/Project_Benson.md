Well, I survived my first week of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in San Francisco.  It's definitely been a challenging week, especially due to my 1.5 hour commute from Pleasanton each way.  The good thing is that my instructors are really knowledgeable and super friendly as well as my cohort mates.  I'm very excited about all the things I will learn in the next 11 weeks.
