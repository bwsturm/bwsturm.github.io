Well, I survived my first week of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in San Francisco.  In our first week, we worked on Project Benson.  A description of the project along with some of our findings will be the subject of this blog post.

### Introduction

Project Benson involved exploring MTA Turnstile Data from the city of New York.  The basic premise is that we had to use this data in some way that could be useful to some prospective client doing business in New York.  The client is something that we can make up.  Our goal is to pitch them idea related to the MTA data that could be useful to their business.
